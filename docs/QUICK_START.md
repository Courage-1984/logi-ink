# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will open at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement (changes auto-reload).

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized `dist/` folder ready for deployment.
